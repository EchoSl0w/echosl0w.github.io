## $whoami

Greetings reader, I'm Echo_Slow (Mijo Misic). You've probably seen me around in some Discord channels. If not, let me introduce myself to you. I have 2+ years of penetration testing experience and I'm a sucker for diving deep into things and learning how they work under the proverbial hood. This blog will contain such deep dives into topics ranging from Windows, Active Directory, Malware, and (Mobile) Exploit Development. In addition to that, I'm also doing write-ups of Hack The Box machines/challenges which you can find under the writeups tab. For your convenience (as to not check everyday if I published) I also provide two RSS feeds, one for the technical stuff and the other for the Hack The Box write-ups.

## Certifications

I like to collect badges, but these should not be used to solely determine someone's skill.
